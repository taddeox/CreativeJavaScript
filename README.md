The basic idea of this page is a counter of how much (on average) Bill Gates makes while the user is on the page. This estimate was calculated using Bill's gain of money over the past two years - then calculating how much that works out to be on an average second - $130. Then I broke it down even more because I wanted the total to update more than once a second and I wanted the the dollar place and the decimal places to be moving up as well. this worked out to be every 87 miliseconds Bill makes about $11.31.

Bonus hidden feature - if the user clicks on Bill's picture, a new picture of Bill and one of his newest friends takes it's place.
